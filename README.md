# Auto_Typing
This Python script utilizes the `pyautogui` library to simulate typing and pressing the "enter" key. It repeats the process a specified number of times.

# Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can install the required library using:

```bash
pip install pyautogui

# Configuration
You can customize the script by modifying the following parameters:
time.sleep(1): Adjust the sleep time (in seconds) before the script starts.
count <= 100000: Change the condition to control the number of iterations.
pyautogui.typewrite("HOLA, I AM ANUBHAV"): Modify the string to the desired text.
